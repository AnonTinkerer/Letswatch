# Letswatch
iOS and F-Droid App to review and share interest in various shows/movies available on user's selected streaming services.  Idea is that one's significant other and them can link their accounts, agree on what shows to watch in a tinder-like style.  

Because I'm not a developer, I'm going to try and use appsheets and google sheets.  Although that does hurt my soul as I am not a fan of google's ethcial practices.  I do support FOSS and hope this project can become FOSS.
